Avast releases security patches as needed, depending on any newly discovered vulnerabilities.

**4. Feature Enhancements**

Occasionally, Avast will release updates that introduce new features or enhance existing capabilities. These feature enhancements may include improvements to the user interface, new tools for scanning and detecting threats, or enhanced privacy features. Feature enhancements ensure that Avast antivirus remains a competitive and comprehensive cybersecurity solution.

-----------------------------------------

While Avast antivirus updates are essential for maintaining robust security, users may sometimes encounter issues during the update process. Here are a few common problems and troubleshooting steps:
